http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/register/

> add VerifyUserEmail view to accounts/views.py
> add url for it in accounts/urls.py
> run server and test the route:
http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/verify-email/
> got error, (video did not get error):
AssertionError:
'VerifyUserEmail' should either include a `serializer_class` attribute, or override the `get_serializer_class()` method.
> think it needs a api view cannot work without a serializer
> i need to implement this on my own
testuser2@gmail.com
> needed to register a new user, and get an otp, appears to be working, need to check the is verified field of user using admin
> can't remember admin, need a new superuser: shit234@gmail.com-al-do-1
> is_verified is true for user testuser2@gmail.com, testing the same otp again to generate error
> committing
> add login user view to accounts/views.py

> pip install djangorestframework-simplejwt
> add configs for simplejwt to settings.py

> we will use this package to generate tokens manually (for token method of user model)
